# Order Details Page Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The order details page has been successfully refactored to consolidate all custom hooks into a single, cohesive custom hook while maintaining clean separation between logic and rendering.

## What Was Changed

### Before (Multiple Custom Hooks)
The component was using multiple custom hooks scattered across different concerns:
- `useTabManagement` - Tab state management
- `useOrderDetails` - Order data fetching and management
- `useGetPrintPalletLabelsQuery` - Pallet labels API call
- Multiple utility functions imported directly in component
- useState for sidebar management
- Complex state management across multiple hooks

### After (Single Custom Hook)
All logic has been consolidated into one custom hook `useOrderDetailsPage` that:
- Manages all UI state (sidebar, tabs)
- Handles all API calls (order details, pallet labels)
- Processes and provides safe data accessors
- Manages error states and loading states
- Provides computed values and handlers

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. New Custom Hook: `features/order-details/hooks/useOrderDetailsPage.ts`

**Key Features:**
- **Single Entry Point**: All order details logic in one place
- **Clean API**: Returns organized data and handlers
- **Safe Data Access**: Pre-computed safe data objects to avoid repetitive null checks
- **Comprehensive State Management**: Handles UI state, data state, loading states, and error states
- **Memoized Computations**: Optimized with useMemo for performance

**Hook Structure:**
```typescript
export function useOrderDetailsPage({ orderId }) {
  return {
    // UI State
    sidebarOpen,
    activeTab,
    
    // Data State
    orderDetails,
    safeData, // Pre-computed safe accessors
    isOverallLoading,
    hasError,
    errorMessage,
    isEmpty,
    
    // Order Info
    transactionId,
    orderStatus,
    serviceType,
    shippingStatus,
    
    // Pallet Labels
    palletLabelsData,
    palletLabelsError,
    palletLabelsLoading,
    
    // Computed
    breadcrumbItems,
    
    // Handlers
    handleTabChange,
    handleSidebarToggle,
    handleSidebarClose,
    handleRetry
  }
}
```

### 2. Refactored Component: `features/order-details/components/order-details-page-content.tsx`

**Key Improvements:**
- **Single Hook Usage**: Only uses one custom hook
- **Clean Rendering Logic**: Focuses purely on rendering and user interactions
- **Reduced Imports**: Eliminated multiple utility imports
- **Simplified State Access**: All state accessed through the hook's return value
- **Better Error Handling**: Streamlined error and loading state handling

## Benefits of This Approach

### 1. **Better Organization**
- All business logic is contained in one place
- Clear separation between data/logic (hook) and presentation (component)
- Easier to test the logic separately from the UI

### 2. **Improved Maintainability**
- Single source of truth for all order details functionality
- Easier to debug issues - check the hook first
- Changes to business logic only require updating one file

### 3. **Enhanced Reusability**
- The hook can be reused in other components if needed
- Logic is decoupled from specific UI implementation
- Easier to create different views of the same data

### 4. **Better Performance**
- Memoized computations reduce unnecessary re-calculations
- Safe data accessors are computed once and reused
- Optimized re-renders through proper dependency management

### 5. **Simplified Testing**
- Hook can be tested independently using `@testing-library/react-hooks`
- Component tests can focus on rendering behavior
- Mock the hook easily for component testing

## Code Quality Improvements

### Before:
```tsx
// Multiple imports and hooks scattered throughout
const [sidebarOpen, setSidebarOpen] = useState(false);
const { activeTab, loading: tabLoading, handleTabChange } = useTabManagement("order-details");
const { orderDetails, isLoading, hasError, ... } = useOrderDetails(orderId);
const { data: palletLabelsData, ... } = useGetPrintPalletLabelsQuery(payload, options);

// Repetitive safe accessor calls
<AttachmentsTable attachments={getSafeAttachments(orderDetails)} />
<TransportationDetails handlingDetails={getSafeHandlingDetails(orderDetails)} />
```

### After:
```tsx
// Single hook with everything
const {
  sidebarOpen, activeTab, orderDetails, safeData,
  isOverallLoading, hasError, handleTabChange, handleRetry, ...
} = useOrderDetailsPage({ orderId })

// Clean, pre-computed data access
<AttachmentsTable attachments={safeData.attachments} />
<TransportationDetails handlingDetails={safeData.handlingDetails} />
```

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Single Responsibility**: The hook manages all order details concerns
2. **Clean Interface**: Hook returns a well-structured object
3. **Error Handling**: Centralized error state management
4. **Performance**: Memoized expensive computations
5. **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript interfaces
6. **Separation of Concerns**: Logic in hook, rendering in component

## Future Extensibility

This pattern makes it easy to:
- Add new tab types by extending the hook
- Implement additional API calls within the same hook
- Add new computed values or handlers
- Modify business logic without touching the UI
- Create alternative UI implementations using the same hook

## Migration Benefits

- **Reduced Complexity**: Fewer moving parts to track
- **Better Debugging**: One place to look for issues
- **Improved Documentation**: Hook serves as documentation of all features
- **Easier Onboarding**: New developers only need to understand one hook
- **Consistent Patterns**: Establishes a pattern for other complex pages
